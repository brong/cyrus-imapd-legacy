		    WARNING: MAKEDEPEND COULD NOT BE FOUND

Makedepend did not run because the configure script did not find it when it
was run.  You can fix this by compiling and installing the version from the
makedepend subdirectory in the distribution.

You're probably seeing this warning message a lot, but that's okay.
