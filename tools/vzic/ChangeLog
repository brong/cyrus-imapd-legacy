	* Released Vzic 1.3

	* vzic-output.c (expand_tzname): added special case for America/Nome.
	(output_rrule): made hacks a bit more general, to handle Asia/Gaza
	which now has a day=4 rule. At some point we should check what newer
	versions of Outlook can handle so we can be more accurate.

	* vzic-dump.c (dump_time_zone_names): try looking for timezone info
	using original and linked name.

	* README, *.c: fixed spelling 'compatable' -> 'compatible'.

	* vzic.c: patch from Jonathan Guthrie to support a --olson-dir option.

	* Released Vzic 1.2

2003-10-25  Damon Chaplin  <damon@gnome.org>

	* vzic-output.c: 
	* Makefile: moved the PRODUCT_ID and TZID_PREFIX settings to the
	Makefile and changed the default so people don't accidentally use
	the same IDs as Evolution.

	* vzic-parse.c (parse_time): substitute 23:59:59 when we read a time
	of 24:00:00. This is a bit of a kludge to avoid problems, since
	24:00:00 is not a valid iCalendar time. Since 24:00:00 is only used
	for a few timezones in the 1930s it doesn't matter too much.
	
	To write a correct fix we'd need to review all the code that deals
	with times to see if it would be affected, e.g. a time of 24:00 on
	one day should be considered equal to 0:00 the next day.

	We'd also need to adjust the output times to use 0:00 the next day
	rather than 24:00. If we need to output recurrence rules that would
	be a problem, since 'last saturday at 24:00' can't be easily
	converted to another rule that uses 0:00 instead.

	* Released Vzic 1.1

2003-10-22  Damon Chaplin  <damon@gnome.org>

	* vzic-parse.c (parse_time): allow a time of 24:00, as used in
	the America/Montreal and America/Toronto rules in the 1930s!
	I'm not 100% sure the rest of the code will handle this OK, but
	it only affects the 'pure' output.
