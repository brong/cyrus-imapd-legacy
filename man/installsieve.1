.SH NAME
installsieve \- user utility for managing sieve scripts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B installsieve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I installsieve
is a utility that allows users to manage their sieve scripts kept on
the server.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.I -v <name>
View script with the given name. The script if retrieved sucessfully
is output to standard output.

.I -l
List all of the scripts currently on the server. If one of the scripts
is active a arrow is printed indicating that it is the active script.

.I -p <port>
Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to "sieve" as defined in
/etc/services.

.I -i <file>
Install a file onto the server. If a script with the same name already
exists on the server it is overwritten. Upon sucessfully putting the
script on the server the script is set active. If <file> has the
extension .script it is chopped when put on the server since sieve
names may not contain a '.'.

.I -a <name>
Set <name> as the active script. The list of available names can be
obtained from the '-l' option..

.I -d <name>
Delete the sieve script on the server with <name>.

.I -m <mechanism>
Force installsieve to use <mechanism> for authentication. If not
specified the strongest authentication mechanism is chosen.

.I -g <name>
Get the sieve script with <name> and save it to disk with a ".script"
extension. If a file with that name already exists it is
overwritten.

.I -u <user>
Userid/Authname to use for authentication; by default, the current user.
