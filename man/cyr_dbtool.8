.SH DESCRIPTION
.I cyr_dbtool
is used to manage a cyrusdb file. The usable actions are:
.PP
.BI show " [<prefix>]"
.PP
.BI get " <key>"
.PP
.BI set " <key> <value>"
.PP
.BI delete " <key>"
.PP
.BI consistency
.PP
.BI repack
.PP
You may omit key or key/value and specify one per line on stdin. Keys are
terminated by tab or newline, values are terminated by newline.
.PP
Running without any options will list the available database backends and
usable actions.
.PP
The 'consistency' command runs a consistency check on the DB by calling
'myconsistent' on it.
.PP
The 'repack' command will compress the database by removing stale data
on backends which support it.  It's a NOOP otherwise.
.PP
.I cyr_dbtool
reads any applicable configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
note that the file locations are NOT read out of the configuration file,
and must be supplied on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"

.TP
.BI \-n

.TP
.BI \-o
Store all the output in memory and only print it once the transaction
is completed.
.TP

default used to be transactions.
