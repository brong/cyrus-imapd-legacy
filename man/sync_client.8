.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sync_client
is the client side of the replication system.  It runs on the client
(master) system and connects to the target (replica) system and
generates an appropriate sequence of transactions to synchronize the
replica system with the master system.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.BI \-l
Verbose logging mode.
.TP
.BI \-o
Only attempt to connect to the backend server once rather than waiting
up to 1000 seconds before giving up.
.TP
.BI \-z
Enable compress.
If you set 'sync_compress' in the imapd.conf or pass -z to sync_client, the
replication protocol will attempt to enable deflate compression on the
connection.
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
.BI \-S " servername"
Tells
.B sync_client
which server to communicate with.  Overrides the \fIsync_host\fR
configuration option.
.TP
.BI \-f " input-file"
In mailbox or user replication mode: provides list of users or mailboxes
to replicate.  In rolling replication mode, specifies an alternate log
file (sync_client will exit after processing the log file).
.TP
.BI \-F " shutdown-file"
Rolling replication checks for this file at the end of each replication
cycle and shuts down if it is present. Used to request nice clean shutdown
at first convenient point. The file in question is removed on shutdown.
Overrides
.I sync_shutdown_file
option in
.I imapd.conf
.TP
.BI \-w " interval"
Wait this long before starting. Typically used so that we can attach a
debugger to one end of the replication system or the other.
.TP
.BI \-t " timeout"
Timeout for single replication run in rolling replication.
.B sync_client
will negotiate a restart after this many seconds. Default: 600 seconds
.TP
.BI \-d " delay"
Minimum delay between replication runs in rolling replication mode.
Larger values provide better efficiency as transactions can be merged.
Smaller values mean that the replica system is more up to date and that
you don't end up with large blocks of replication transactions as a single
group. Default: 3 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-r
Rolling (repeat) replication mode. Pick up a list of actions recorded by
the
.B lmtpd(8), imapd(8), popd(8) and nntpd(8)
daemons from the file specified in
.I sync_log_file.
Repeat until
.I sync_shutdwon_file
appears.
.TP
.BI \-u
User mode.
Remaining arguments are list of users who should be replicated.
.TP
.BI \-m
Mailbox mode.
Remaining arguments are list of mailboxes which should be replicated.
.TP
.BI \-s
Sieve mode.
Remaining arguments are list of users whose Sieve files should be replicated.
Principally used for debugging purposes: not exposed to
.B sync_client(8).
