.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pop3d
is a POP3 server.
It accepts commands on its standard input and responds on its standard output.
It MUST invoked by
.IR master (8)
with those descriptors attached to a remote client connection.
.PP
.I Pop3d
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
.PP
If the directory
.RI log/ user
exists under the directory specified in the
.I configdirectory
configuration option, then
.I pop3d
will create protocol telemetry logs for sessions authenticating as
.IR user .
The telemetry logs will be stored in the 
.RI log/ user
directory with a filename of the
.I pop3d
process-id.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
.BI \-U " uses"
The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new
connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.
.TP
.BI \-T " timeout"
The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new connection
before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero) will disable the
timeout.  The default is 60.
.TP
.BI \-D
Run external debugger specified in debug_command.
.TP
.BI \-s
Serve POP3 over SSL (pop3s).  All data to and from
.I pop3d
is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer.
.TP
.B \-k
Serve MIT's KPOP (Kerberized POP) protocol instead.
.TP
.BI \-p " ssf"
Tell
.I pop3d
that an external layer exists.  An SSF (security strength factor) of 1
means an integrity protection layer exists.  Any higher SSF implies
some form of privacy protection.
