.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mbexamine
will examine the header, index, and cache files of a cyrus format mailbox
and dump the information contained therein.  It can also limit its output
to a specific uid or sequence number, through use of the -s and -u switches.
.I Mbexamine
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.  It uses the mboxlist database
to locate the mailbox on disk.
.SH OPTIONS

Compare the quota usage in cyrus.index to the actual message file
sizes and report any differences.  If there are differences, the
mailbox SHOULD be reconstructed.
