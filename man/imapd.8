.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Imapd
is an IMAP4rev1 server.
It accepts commands on its standard input and responds on its standard output.
It MUST be invoked by
.IR master (8)
with those descriptors attached to a remote client connection.
.PP
.I Imapd
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
.PP
If the file
msg/shutdown
is created under the directory specified in the
.I configdirectory
configuration option, then
.I imapd
will shut down the connection, sending the first line contained in the
file to the client as the reason.  New connections are denied.
.PP
If the file
msg/motd
is created under the directory specified in the
.I configdirectory
configuration option, then
.I imapd
will send the first line contained in the file to clients upon connect as
an ALERT message which IMAP-compliant clients are required to display.
This option serves to annoy users mostly.  Unfortunately clients tend to
connect far more frequently than is apparent, causing each connection to
generate a seperate server ALERT for each connection.  Many clients do not
display these properly, if they do anything with them at all.
.PP
If the directory
.RI log/ user
exists under the directory specified in the
.I configdirectory
configuration option, then
.I imapd
will create protocol telemetry logs for sessions authenticating as
.IR user .
The telemetry logs will be stored in the 
.RI log/ user
directory with a filename of the
.I imapd
process-id.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
.BI \-U " uses"
The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new
connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.
.TP
.BI \-T " timeout"
The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new connection
before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero) will disable the
timeout.  The default is 60.
.TP
.BI \-D
Run external debugger specified in debug_command.
.TP
.BI \-s
Serve IMAP over SSL (imaps).  All data to and from
.I imapd
is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer.
.TP
.BI \-N
Bypass password checking.  (Not recommended unless you know what you're doing.)
.TP
.BI \-p " ssf"
Tell
.I imapd
that an external layer exists.  An SSF (security strength factor) of 1
means an integrity protection layer exists.  Any higher SSF implies
some form of privacy protection.
