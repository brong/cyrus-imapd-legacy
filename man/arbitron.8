.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Arbitron
collects and reports readership statistics for mailboxes on the
server.  It also optionally prunes the mailboxes of \\Seen state for
dormant users.
.PP
.I Arbitron
produces one line of output per mailbox, reporting the mailbox name
followed by a space, followed by the number of
readers (and if -u is specified, followed by a colon and a
comma-separated list of the readers userids), and if -o is not
specified, another space and the number of subscribers (and if -u is
specified, followed by a colon and a comma-separated list of the
subscribers userids).
\fBIMPORTANT: This format is subject to change in future versions.\fR

Personal mailboxes are not reported unless there is at least one
reader other than the mailboxes owner.
