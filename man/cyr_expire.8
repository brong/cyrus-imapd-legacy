cyr_expire \- expire messages and duplicate delivery database entries

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBCyr_expire\fR is used to run a number of regular maintenance tasks
on Cyrus databases, specifically:
.IP \(bu 2m
expire messages from mailboxes, and
.IP \(bu 2m
expire entries from the duplicate delivery database, and
.IP \(bu 2m
cleanse mailboxes of partially expunged messages (when
using the "delayed" expunge mode), and
.IP \(bu 2m
remove deleted mailboxes (when using the "delayed" delete mode), and
.IP \(bu 2m
expire entries from conversations databases.
.PP
The expiration of messages is controlled by the
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR mailbox annotation which
specifies the age (in days) of messages in the given mailbox that
should be deleted.  A value of 0 means that no expiration is to be
performed on that mailbox.
.PP
The value of the \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR annotation is
inherited by all children of the mailbox on which it is set, so an entire
mailbox tree can be configured by setting a single annotation on the
root of that tree.  If a mailbox does not have a
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR annotation set on it (or does not
inherit one), then no messages are expired from the mailbox.
.PP
The annotation can be examined using the \fBinfo\fR command of
\fBcyradm(1p)\fR, and modified using the \fBmboxconfig\fR and
\fBsetinfo\fR commands of \fBcyradm(1p)\fR.
.PP
Expiration of duplicate delivery database entries for a given mailbox
is also controlled by the \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR annotation
which applies to that mailbox.  Unlike message expiration, if no
annotation applies to the mailbox then duplicate database entries are
expired using the value given to the \fB-E\fR option.
.PP
Expiration of conversations database entries occurs if the
\fBconversations\fP option is present in \fIimapd.conf\fP.  Expiration
can be disabled using the \fB\-c\fP option.  The period used to
expire entries is controlled by the \fBconversations_expire_days\fP
option in \fIimapd.conf\fP.
.PP
\fBCyr_expire\fR reads its configuration options out of the \fIimapd.conf\fR(5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-C\fI config-file\fR
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
\fB\-D \fIdelete-duration\fR
Remove previously deleted mailboxes older than \fIdelete-duration\fR
(when using the "delayed" delete mode).
The value can be a floating point number, and may have a suffix to
specify the unit of time.  If no suffix, the value is number of days.
Valid suffixes are \fBd\fR (days), \fBh\fR (hours),
\fBm\fR (minutes) and \fBs\fR (seconds).
.TP
\fB\-E \fIexpire-duration\fR
Prune the duplicate database of entries older than \fIexpire-duration\fR.
This value is only used for entries which do not have a corresponding
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR mailbox annotation.
Format is the same as delete-duration.
.TP
\fB\-X \fIexpunge-duration\fR
Expunge previously deleted messages older than \fIexpunge-duration\fR
(when using the "delayed" expunge mode).
Format is the same as delete-duration.
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Do not expire conversation database entries, even if the conversations
feature is enabled.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Do not expunge messages even if using delayed expunge mode.  This reduces IO
traffic considerably, allowing \fBcyr_expire\fR to be run frequently to clean
up the duplicate database without overloading the machine.
.TP
\fB\-p \fImailbox-prefix\fR
Only find mailboxes starting with this prefix,  e.g.
"user.justgotspammedlots".
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose output.
.TP
.B \-a
Skip the annotation lookup, so all \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR
annotations are ignored entirely.  It behaves as if they were not set, so
only \fIexpire-days\fR is considered for all mailboxes.
