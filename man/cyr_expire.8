.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cyr_expire
is used to expire messages and duplicate delivery database entries.
.I Cyr_expire
also cleanses mailboxes of partially expunged messages
(when using the "delayed" expunge mode).
The expiration of messages is controlled by the
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR mailbox annotation which
specifies the age (in days) of messages in the given mailbox that
should be deleted.  Any duplicate delivery database entries which
correspond to the mailbox are also deleted at the same frequency.
.br
.sp
The value of the \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR annotation is
inherited by all children of the given mailbox, so an entire mailbox
tree can be expired by seting a single annotation on the root of that
tree.  If a mailbox does not have a
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR annotation set on it (or does not
inherit one), then no messages are expired from the mailbox.
.PP
.I Cyr_expire
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
\fB\-D \fIdelete-days\fR
Remove previously deleted mailboxes older than \fIdelete-days\fR
(when using the "delayed" delete mode).  The default is 0 (zero)
days, which will delete \fBall\fR previously deleted mailboxes.
.TP
\fB\-E \fIexpire-days\fR
Prune the duplicate database of entries older than \fIexpire-days\fR.  This
value is only used for entries which do not have a corresponding
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR mailbox annotation.
.TP
\fB\-X \fIexpunge-days\fR
Expunge previously deleted messages older than \fIexpunge-days\fR
(when using the "delayed" expunge mode).  The default is 0 (zero)
days, which will expunge \fBall\fR previously deleted messages.
.TP
\fB\-p \fImailbox-prefix\fR
Only find mailboxes starting with this prefix.  e.g.
"user.justgotspammedlots"
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose output.
.TP
.B \-a
Skip the annotation lookup, so all \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire\fR
annotations are ignored entirely.  It behaves as if they were not set, so
only \fIexpire-days\fR is considered for all mailboxes.
