.SH DESCRIPTION
Generate MD5 checksums for messages given set of users. Works as
incremental update: reads in existing set of MD5 checksums from
\fImd5_dir/u/userid\fR (hashed on first letter of userid) if that file
exists. Scans account looking for new messages, and then updates record.

The MD5 checksums which are generated are used to test integrity of the
master, replica and backup systems on Hermes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
.BI \-D " md5_dir"
Read and write MD5 checksums from \fImd5_dir\fR, overrides configuration
file setting of the same name.
.TP
.BI \-k " count"
Concurrency level: run up to
.I count
asynchronous child processes.
.TP
.BI \-f " input_file"
List of accounts to process: use in place of command line arguments.
.TP
.BI \-m " offset"
Regenerate given fraction of the user database in combination with \-M below.
.TP
.BI \-M " modulo"
Regenerate MD5 checksums for given fraction of user database. Allows for
rolling consisency checks.
.TP
.BI \-v
Verbose mode.
