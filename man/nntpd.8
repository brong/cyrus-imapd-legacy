.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nntpd
is a NNTP server.
It accepts commands on its standard input and responds on its standard output.
It MUST invoked by
.IR master (8)
with those descriptors attached to a remote client connection.
.PP
.I Nntpd
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.  The optional
.I newsprefix
option specifies a prefix to be prepended to newsgroup names to make
the corresponding IMAP mailbox names.  The optional
.I newspostuser
option specifies the special userid to be used when contructing the To:
header address for following up to articles when read via IMAP.  The
optional
.I newspeer
option specifies the fully qualified hostname of the upstream news
server to which articles are fed.  The optional
.I allownewnews
option enables the NNTP NEWNEWS command.  NOTE: For servers with a large
volume of articles, the NEWNEWS command can be expensive.
.PP
If the directory
.RI log/ user
exists under the directory specified in the
.I configdirectory
configuration option, then
.I nntpd
will create protocol telemetry logs for sessions authenticating as
.IR user .
The telemetry logs will be stored in the 
.RI log/ user
directory with a filename of the
.I nntpd
process-id.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
.BI \-U " uses"
The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new
connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.
.TP
.BI \-T " timeout"
The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new connection
before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero) will disable the
timeout.  The default is 60.
.TP
.BI \-D
Run external debugger specified in debug_command.
.TP
.BI \-s
Serve NNTP over SSL (nntps).  All data to and from
.I nntpd
is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer.
.TP
.BI \-r
Only allow NNTP reader commands.  Permitted clients will only be
allowed to read/post articles.
.TP
.BI \-f
Only allow NNTP feeder commands.  Permitted clients will only be
allowed to feed articles (no reading).
.TP
.BI \-p " ssf"
Tell
.I nntpd
that an external layer exists.  An SSF (security strength factor) of 1
means an integrity protection layer exists.  Any higher SSF implies
some form of privacy protection.
