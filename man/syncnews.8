.SH NAME
syncnews \- synchronize IMAP news mailboxes with active file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B syncnews
[
.B \-C
.I config-file
]
.I active-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Syncnews
compares the list of IMAP news mailboxes with the news active file.
News mailboxes which are not listed in the active file are removed.
Newsgroups listed in the active file but not in the IMAP mailboxes
file have IMAP mailboxes created.
.PP
A newsgroup must have a status of ``y'', ``m'', or ``n'' to be
considered listed in the active file.
.PP
.I Syncnews
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/imapd.conf
.SH BUGS
If a newsgroup is listed in the active file, but does not have the
news spool directories created, 
.I syncnews
will create those news spool directories in the process of creating
the IMAP mailbox.  The created directories are likely to then have
ownership and permissions that do not permit the news server to write
article files.
