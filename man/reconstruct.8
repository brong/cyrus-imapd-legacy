.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Reconstruct
rebuilds one or more IMAP mailboxes.  When invoked with the
.B \-m
switch, it rebuilds the master
mailboxes file.  It can be used to recover from
almost any sort of data corruption.
.PP
If
.I Reconstruct
can find existing header and index files, it attempts to preserve any
data in them that is not derivable from the message files themselves.
The state 
.I reconstruct
attempts to preserve includes the flag names, flag state, and
internaldate.
.I Reconstruct
derives all other information from the message files.
.PP
.I Reconstruct
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.  Any mailbox directory
underneath the path specified in the
.I partition-news
configuration option is assumed to be in news format.
.PP
.I Reconstruct
does not adjust the quota usage recorded in any quota
root files.  After running
.IR reconstruct ,
it is advisable to run
.IR quota (8)
with the
.I \-f
switch in order to fix the quota root files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
.BI \-p " partition"
Search for the listed (non-existant) mailboxes on the indicated partition.
Create the mailboxes in the database in addition to reconstructing them.
(not compatible with the use of wildcards)
.TP
.B \-x
When processing a mailbox which is not in the mailbox list (e.g. via
the -p or -f options), do not import the metadata from the mailbox,
instead create it anew (this specifically affects at least the mailbox's seen
state unique identifier, user flags, and ACL).
.TP
.B \-r
Recursively reconstruct all sub-mailboxes of the mailboxes or mailbox
prefixes given as arguments.
.TP
.B \-f
Examine the filesystem underneath mailbox, adding all directories with
a cyrus.header found there as new mailboxes.  Useful for
restoring mailboxes from backups.
.TP
.B \-k
Preserve the cyrus.expunge file and the corresponding message files 
instead of deleting them. 
.TP
.B \-s
Adds synchronization records to the log, so the synchronization 
service can replicate the changes.
.TP
.B \-g
Clear existing or regenerated GUIDs for all messages.
.TP
.B \-G
Force regeneration of GUIDs for all messages.
.TP
.B \-m
.B NOTE: CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE
.br
Rebuild the
.I
mailboxes
file.  Use whatever data in the existing
.I mailboxes
file it can scavenge, then scans all partitions listed in the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file for additional mailboxes.
.SH EXAMPLES
You want to reconstruct the index files for a user, you have recovered a deleted mail file from backup
and given it a suitable name (eg user/ben-lacy/33.), but it is not visible since it is not indexed:

.nf
reconstruct -r user.ben-lacy
.fi
.PP
If you have the \fBunixhierarchysep:yes\fR option set in \fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR you would need
to run:

.nf
reconstruct -r user/ben.lacy
.fi
