.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Deliver
reads a message from the standard input and delivers it to one or more
IMAP mailboxes.
.PP
.I Deliver
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
.B \-d
Ignored for compatability with 
.B /bin/mail.
.TP
.BI \-r " address"
Insert a 
.B Return-Path: 
header containing
.I address
.TP
.BI \-f " address"
Insert a 
.B Return-Path: 
header containing
.I address
.TP
.BI \-m " mailbox"
Deliver to 
.IR mailbox .
If any
.IR userid s
are specified, attempts to deliver to
.RI user. userid . mailbox
for each 
.IR userid .
If the ACL on any such mailbox does not grant the sender the "p" right
or if 
.B \-m
is not specified,
then delivers to the INBOX for the
.IR userid ,
regardless of the ACL on the INBOX.
.IP
If no
.IR userid s
are specified, attempts to deliver to
.IR mailbox .
If the ACL on
.I mailbox
does not grant the sender the "p" right, the delivery fails.
.TP
.BI \-a " auth-id"
Specify the authorization id of the sender.  Defaults to "anonymous".
.TP
.B \-q
Deliver message even when receiving mailbox is over quota.
.TP
.B \-l
Accept messages using the LMTP protocol.
.SH NOTES
Depending on the setting of \fBreject8bit\fR in \fBimapd.conf(5)\fR, deliver
either rejects/accepts messages with 8-bit-set characters in the headers.
If we accept messages with 8-bit-set characters in the headers, then depending
on the setting of \fBmunge8bit\fR, these characters are either left un-touched
or changed to `X'.
This is because such characters can't be interpreted since the
character set is not known, although some communities not well-served by
US-ASCII assume that those characters can be used to represent characters not
present in US-ASCII.
.PP
A method for encoding 8-bit-set characters is provided by RFC 2047.
