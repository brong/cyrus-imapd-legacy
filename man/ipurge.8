.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ipurge
deletes messages from the mailbox(es) specified by
\fImailbox-pattern\fR that are older or larger than specified by the
\fB-d\fR, \fB-b\fR, \fB-k\fR or \fB-m\fR options.  If no
\fImailbox-pattern\fR is given, \fIipurge\fR works on all mailboxes.  If the
\fB-x\fR option is given, the message age and size MUST match exactly
those specified by \fB-d\fR, \fB-b\fR, \fB-k\fR or \fB-m\fR.  The are
no default values, and at least one of \fB-d\fR, \fB-b\fR, \fB-k\fR or
\fB-m\fR MUST be specified.
.PP
.I Ipurge
by default only deletes mail below shared folders, which means that mails
in mailbox(es) below INBOX.* and user.* stay untouched. Use the option
\fB-f\fR to also delete mail in mailbox(es) below these folders.
.PP
.I Ipurge
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
