/*
 * Description of multiple address family support from
 * Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume@mahoroba.org>:
 *
 * In service_create(), master tries to listen each address family which
 * getaddrinfo() returns.  With existing implementation of getaddrinfo(),
 * when a protocol is not specified exactly by proto= in cyrus.conf and a
 * platform supports an IPv4 and an IPv6, getaddrinfo() returns two
 * struct addrinfo chain which contain INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0; IPv4) and
 * IN6ADDR_ANY (::; IPv6), then master will listen an IPv4 and an IPv6. 
 *
 * As a result, one SERVICE entry in cyrus.conf may correspond to two
 * Service memory blocks; one is for an IPv6 and the other is for an
 * IPv4.  The associate field was introduced to intend to distinguish
 * whether the entry is primary or not.  The associate field of primary
 * block is 0, 2nd is 1, 3rd is 2, ...
 * The blocks share same memory area of name, listen and proto.
 *
 *    +----------------+
 *    | Service[i]     |
 *    |   associate: 0 |
 *    |   name         | --------------> name
 *    |   listen       | ----- /- -----> listen
 *    |   proto        | ---- /- / ----> proto
 *    +----------------+     /  / /
 *    | Service[j]     |    /  / /
 *    |   associate: 1 |   /  / /
 *    |   name         |--/  / /
 *    |   listen       |----/ /
 *    |   proto        |-----/
 *    +----------------+
 *
 * This field is intended to avoid duplicate free by doing free only when
 * associate is zero.
