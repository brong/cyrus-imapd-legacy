# This script WON'T work for you.  Guaranteed.
# It checks CMU ECE policy, and your policy *will* be different.
# Use it only as an example of how to use Cyrus::IMAP::Admin, as it will
# almost certainly be useless to you as an actual program.
#
# This script sanity-checks departmental accounts against both the password
# file and Cyrus.  It makes a LOT of CMU ECE-specific assumptions.  It also
# doesn't do much with Cyrus aside from authenticating and getting a list of
# top-level mailboxes, but this is currently all I have in the way of Perl
# that uses IMAP::Cyrus.
