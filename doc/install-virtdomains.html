<h1>Configuring Virtual Domains</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Virtual domains is the practice of hosting a service for more than one
domain on one server.  Cyrus IMAP has the ability to host IMAP/POP
mailboxes for multiple domains (e.g., <tt>test@example.com</tt> and
<tt>test@example.net</tt>) on a single server or Murder.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, Cyrus needs to know which domain to look
in when a mailbox is accessed.  There are two ways in which Cyrus can
determine the domain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fully qualified userid - the client logs in with a userid
containing the domain in which the user belongs (e.g.,
<tt>test@example.com</tt> or <tt>test%example.net</tt>)</li>
<li>IP address - the server looks up the domain based on the IP
address of the receiving interface (useful for servers with multiple
NICs or using IP aliasing)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these methods are active if the <tt>virtdomains</tt> option
is set to <tt>on</tt> (or <tt>yes</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, <tt>true</tt>) and
can be used in conjunction with one another. If the
<tt>virtdomains</tt> option is set to <tt>userid</tt>, then only the
first method is used. Note that a fully qualified userid takes
precedence over a domain obtained from the IP address.</p>

<h3>Concepts</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most important part of this process is to understand
the changes in the paradigm.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Everyone is in a domain</b> - It's best to think of every user
as existing inside a domain.  Unqualified users are technically inside the
<tt>defaultdomain</tt>.</li>
<li><b>Names can be qualified</b> - Global admins can reference
mailboxes and IDs by qualified names.  That is, for any given mailbox
command, you can add <tt>@domain</tt> to the end of the mailbox name.
Here are some examples:
 <ul>
    <li><tt>cyradm> create user.jill@example.net</tt> <em>(create a
    user)</em></li>
    <li><tt>cyradm> create user.rick@example.net</tt> <em>(create
    another user)</em></li>
    <li><tt>cyradm> setquota user.rick@example.net 50000</tt>
    <em>(define a quota)</em></li>
    <li><tt>cyradm> setaclmailbox user.rick@example.net
    jill@example.net read</tt> <em>(give Jill read access to Rick's
    mailbox)</em></li>
    <li><tt>cyradm> listmailbox *@example.net</tt> <em>(list all
    mailboxes in the example.net domain)</em></li>
 </ul></li>
 <li><b>Each mailbox exists in only one domain</b></li>
 <li><b>Domains are mutually exclusive</b> - Users only have access to
    mailboxes within their own domain (intra-domain).  The following
    example will not work: <tt>setacl user.jill@herdomain.com
    rick@hisdomain.com read</tt>.
 <li><b>Global and Domain admins</b> - The Cyrus virtual domains
    implementation supports per-domain administrators as well as
    global (inter-domain) administrators.  Domain-specific
    administrators are specified with a fully qualified userid in the
    <tt>admins</tt> option (e.g., <tt>admin@example.net</tt>) and only
    have access to mailboxes in the associated domain.  Global
    administrators are specified with unqualified userids.
</ul>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add <tt>virtdomains: yes</tt> to <tt>imapd.conf</tt></li>
<li>Add a <tt>defaultdomain</tt> entry to <tt>imapd.conf</tt></li>
<li>Use cyradm (as a global or domain admin) to create mailboxes for
each domain.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
Support for virtual domains is enabled by turning on the
<tt>virtdomains</tt> option in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>.

<p>When upgrading from a single domain installation to a virtual
domain installation, the name of the existing domain (domain of the
server hostname) should be specified using the <tt>defaultdomain</tt>
option in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>.  This allows users to continue to
access their mailboxes using unqualified userids.  For example, if the
primary IP address on your server resolves to 'www.xxx.yyy.zzz',
then set <tt>defaultdomain</tt> to 'xxx.yyy.zzz'.

<p>Even for new installations, it is <i>recommended</i> that the
"real" domain of the server (domain of its primary hostname), be set
to the <tt>defaultdomain</tt>.  See <a href=#admins>Administrators</a>
below for further discussion.

<p>Here is a sample <tt>imapd.conf</tt> with a minimal set of configuration
options.</p>

<pre>
configdirectory: /var/imap
partition-default: /var/spool/imap
admins: admin rick.admin@hisdomain.com jill.admin@herdomain.net
virtdomains: yes
defaultdomain: exampleisp.net
</pre>

<p>This example has three domains: exampleisp.net, hisdomain.com, and
herdomain.net.  <tt>admin</tt> can administer all three domains, while
<tt>rick.admin@hisdomain.com</tt> and
<tt>jill.admin@herdomain.net</tt> can only administer their respective
domains.</p>

<p>Note that everyday users should not be administrators.  In the
above example, Jill and Rick have separate administrative accounts for
their domains.</p>

<h3>Multiple IP Addresses</h3>

<p>In order to use a multiple IP address configuration, the server must
be able to do a reverse lookup on the IP address to determine the
hostname of the receiving interface.  For example:</p>

<pre><kbd>
192.168.0.1  ->  mail.example.com
192.168.0.2  ->  mail.example.net
192.168.0.3  ->  mail.foo.bar
</kbd></pre>

<p>Once the server obtains the fully qualified hostname of the
interface, it removes the localpart (i.e., 'mail') and uses the
remainder as the domain for any user that logs in.</p>

<p>This address to hostname mapping would usually be done via DNS,
<tt>/etc/hosts</tt>, NIS, etc.  Configuration of the various naming
services is beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<h3>Delivering mail</h3>

<p>To deliver mail to your virtual domains, configure your MTA so that
the envelope recipient (RCPT TO) passed to <tt>lmtpd</tt> is fully
qualified with the correct domain.</p>

<h4>Configuring Sendmail</h4>

<p>In general, follow the basic <a href=install-configure.html>configuration
instructions</a>.  Here are a few caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li> It is easiest to use the mailertable to route mail to Cyrus,
rather than adding the domain to the local-host-names file ($w).  This
prevents Sendmail from changing the domain name to the local host
name.

<pre>
example.com              cyrusv2:/var/imap/socket/lmtp
</pre></li>

<li> You'll have to use the Cyrus mailer in LMTP mode, and you'll have
to change the mailer flags so that it provides the full domain while
communicating via LMTP.  Specifically these changes:

<pre>
S=EnvFromSMTP/HdrFromSMTP, R=EnvToSMTP
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h3>Mail Clients</h3>
<p>The only changes you'll need to make to mail clients is to change
usernames to the fully qualified domain names, i.e., <tt>user@example.com</tt>.
Note that to support some mail clients, the <tt>user%example.com</tt>
form of userid is also supported.  Users in the default domain will not
need to reconfigure their clients (as unqualified userids are assumed to
be in the default domain).</p>

<a name="admins"><h3>Administration</h3></a>

<p>The Cyrus virtual domains implementation supports per-domain
administrators as well as "global" (inter-domain) administrators.
Domain-specific administrators are specified with a
fully qualified userid in the <tt>admins</tt> option
(e.g., <tt>admin@example.net</tt>) and only have access to mailboxes in
the associated domain.  Mailbox names should be specified in the same
fashion as on a single domain configuration.</p>

<p>Global administrators are specified with an unqualified userid in the
<tt>admins</tt> option and have access to <i>any</i> mailbox on the
server.  Because global admins use unqualified userids, they belong
to the <tt>defaultdomain</tt>.  As a result, you CANNOT have a global
admin without specifying a <tt>defaultdomain</tt>.  Note that when
trying to login as a global admin to a multi-homed server from a remote
machine, it might be necessary to fully qualify the userid with the
<tt>defaultdomain</tt>.</p>

<p>Global admins must use <tt>mailbox@domain</tt> syntax when
specifying mailboxes outside of the <tt>defaultdomain</tt>.  Examples
(using <tt>cyradm</tt>):</p>

<p>To create a new INBOX for user 'test' in <tt>defaultdomain</tt>:</p>

<pre><kbd>
   cm user.test
</kbd></pre>

<p>To create a new INBOX for user 'test' in domain 'example.com':</p>

<pre><kbd>
   cm user.test@example.com
</kbd></pre>

To list all mailboxes in domain 'example.com':</p>

<pre><kbd>
   lm *@example.com
</kbd></pre>
