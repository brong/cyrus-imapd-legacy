<h1>Upgrading From Previous Versions</h1>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.3.15</h2>
<ul>
<li>The SQL detection code in configure has been reworked.  Separate
  options for the include directories and lib directories have been
  added.  Previous SQL options may not work as expected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.3.10</h2>
<ul>
<li>STARTTLS is now allowed for externally preauth'd LMTP connections.
If you don't want STARTTLS to be advertised and used by preauth'd
clients, you can set <tt>&lt;service_name&gt;_tls_cert_file:
disabled</tt> in imapd.conf.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.3.9</h2>
<ul>
<li>The method used for generating Globally Unique IDentifiers used
for replication has been changed to be the SHA1 hash of the messages.
If you wish to upgrade the existing GUIDs in particular mailbox(es) or
the entire server, perform the following steps in the listed order.
Note that is is NOT REQUIRED that existing GUIDs be upgraded.
<ol>
<li>Zero GUIDs on the replica (<tt>reconstruct -g</tt>)</li>
<li>Regenerate GUIDs on the master (<tt>reconstruct -G</tt>)</li>
<li>Regenerate GUIDs on the replica (<tt>reconstruct -G</tt>)</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.3.8</h2>
<ul>
<li> You must install and configure Cyrus SASL version 2.1.17 or later
to use Cyrus IMAP 2.3.9 and later.  You can download SASL at <a
href="http://cyrusimap.web.cmu.edu/downloads.html#sasl">
http://cyrusimap.web.cmu.edu/downloads.html#sasl</a>.</li>

<li>The default value of the <tt>allowplaintext</tt> option has been
changed to disabled (0).  If you need to allow cleartext passwords on
the wire, then you will have to explicitly enable the
<tt>allowplaintext</tt> option in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.3.3 or later (64-bit machines)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to byte alignment issues in cyrus.index, all mailboxes
will have to be reconstructed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.3.4 or 2.3.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any mailboxes which had messages appended/delivered/copied with a
2.3.4 service or copied with a 2.3.5 imapd <b>MUST</b> be
reconstructed in order for the new messages to be displayed by
clients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.2.x or earlier</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to use separate metadata partition(s), you <b>MUST</b>
first shut down Cyrus and then perform the following:
<ol>
<li>Set the <tt>metapartition-*</tt> and <tt>metapartition_files</tt>
options to suit your configuration.  For a full description of these
options, see the <tt>imapd.conf(5)</tt> man page.</li>
<li>Create the metadata partition directory(s) listed in the
<tt>metapartition-*</tt> option(s), setting the ownership and
permissions in same fashion as step 6 of <a
href="install-configure.html">install-configure</a>.</li>
<li>Run the <tt>tools/migrate-metadata</tt> script (as the cyrus user)
to move the metadata files listed in the
<tt>metapartition_files</tt> option from the spool partition(s) to the
new metadata partition(s).  This script may take a long time to run
depending on the number of mailboxes on the server, but presumably the
metadata partitions are located on high speed storage, so the writes
should be relatively fast.</li>
<li>Restart Cyrus.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.2.2 or earlier</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Cyrus database backend configuration is now handled at runtime
using <tt>imapd.conf</tt> options.  If you are not using the default
backend for any of the databases, make sure that you specify the
correct backend(s) in appropriate option(s).</li>
<li>The format of the <tt>newspeer</tt> option has been changed.
The existing format will still be parsed, but the option should be
upgraded to use the new format (see <tt>imapd.conf(5)</tt> for
details).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.2.1 or earlier</h2>
<ul>
<li>The sieve bytecode format has changed again to correct an issue
with the short circuiting of the allof and anyof operators. To
upgrade existing scripts (outside of home directories), you can run the
<tt>tools/masssievec</tt> perl script included with the distribution. It
requires a path to your <tt>sievec</tt> binary.  This should also upgrade
scripts that have already been compiled to bytecode.  For example:
<pre>
masssievec /usr/src/cyrus/sieve/sievec
</pre></li>

</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.2.0 or earlier</h2>

<ul>
<li>The improved directory hashing (fulldirhash) is now a runtime
configuration option.  If you are currently using this feature, then
make sure that you enable the <tt>fulldirhash</tt> option in
<tt>imapd.conf</tt>.</li>

<li>The format of mailbox index files has changed.  They are upgraded on
the fly, so you need to do nothing to upgrade.  However, to downgrade them
you will need to remove the cyrus.index files, and reconstruct the mailboxes,
otherwise the index files will be invalid.</li>

<li><tt>ctl_deliver -E</tt> has been deprecated in favor of
<tt>cyr_expire -E</tt>.  This new tool does both duplicate delivery
database pruning as well as message expunging. You should replace the
appropriate <tt>EVENTS</tt> entry in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt> with one of
those in the sample configurations in the <tt>master/conf</tt>
directory.</li>

<li>The sieve bytecode format has changed.  The new format is encoded in
network byte order, and will be transferable between architechures.  To
upgrade existing scripts (outside of home directories), you can run the
<tt>tools/masssievec</tt> perl script included with the distribution. It
requires a path to your <tt>sievec</tt> binary.  This should also upgrade
scripts that have already been compiled to bytecode.  For example:

<pre>
masssievec /usr/src/cyrus/sieve/sievec
</pre>
</ul>


<h2>Upgrading from 2.1.x or earlier</h2>

<h3>General information (ALL SITES)</h3>

<ul>
<li>The default database formats for the mailbox list and the seen
state databases has been changed to the skiplist backend.  There are
two ways of dealing with this if you have been using the defaults.

<ol>
<li>Specify <tt>--with-mboxlist-db=berkeley</tt> and
<tt>--with-seen-db=flat</tt> to <tt>configure</tt>.  This will
instruct Cyrus to continue to use the previous defaults.</li>

<li>Use the <tt>cvt_cyrusdb</tt> program to directly convert the databases.
This should be done with the server down, and with the binaries from the new
Cyrus distribution.  Change any paths that do not match your configuration.<br>
For the mailbox list, the command looks like:
<pre>
/usr/cyrus/bin/cvt_cyrusdb /var/imap/mailboxes.db berkeley /var/imap/mailboxes.db.new skiplist
mv /var/imap/mailboxes.db.new /var/imap/mailboxes.db
</pre>
Note that the use of full paths to the database files is important.  You
should also backup your old mailboxes database before moving the new one
in.<br />

For the seen state databases, the command to get them all in one fell swoop
looks like:
<pre>
find /var/imap/user -name \*.seen -exec /usr/cyrus/bin/cvt_cyrusdb \{\} flat \{\}.new skiplist \; -exec mv \{\}.new \{\} \;
</pre>

The slashes are important for shell escaping.  Again, you should back
up the contents of your <tt>/var/imap/user</tt> directory before
executing this command. These commands may take some time to complete,
especially if your databases are large.

</li></ol>

We believe that skiplist offers considerable performance advantages
for these two databases over the previous defaults.  </li>

<li>Sieve scripts are now compiled into bytecode.  The program
<tt>sievec</tt> is provided to do this process manually (timsieved will
compile submitted sieve scripts as they are uploaded).  To upgrade
existing scripts (outside of home directories), you can run the
<tt>tools/masssievec</tt> perl script included with the distribution.
It requires a path to your <tt>sievec</tt> binary.  For example:

<pre>
masssievec /usr/src/cyrus/sieve/sievec
</pre>

Note that this will fail for scripts that use the &quot;envelope&quot;
extention but do not require it.  Cyrus 2.1's <tt>timsieved</tt> did
not do appropriate checking that the optional envelope test was
required before it was used.
</li> 

<li> Configuration subsystem changes: 

<ul> 
 <li>The tls_[service]_* configuration options have been removed.  Now
 use [servicename]_tls_*, where servicename is the service identifier
 from <tt>cyrus.conf</tt> for that particular process.</li>

 <li>The <tt>admins</tt> and <tt>lmtp_admins</tt> configuration
 options no longer union. Per-service options completely override
 the default value when they are specified.</li>

 <li><tt>lmtp_allowplaintext</tt> is no longer a defined parameter and must
 be specified using the service name of your lmtp process if you
 require a specific value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specialized information (Murder, AFS, etc.)</h3>

<ul>
<li>The IMAP IDLE command is now supported by proxyd and is controlled
by the <tt>imapidlepoll</tt> option, which is enabled by default (60
seconds).  To disable IMAP IDLE in proxyd, set <tt>imapidlepoll</tt>
to 0.</li>

<li>User moves via RENAME and XFER are now controlled by the
<tt>allowusermoves</tt> option, which defaults to off.</li>

<li>If you use <tt>ptloader</tt>, it now runs as a regular cyrus
service.  This means that you will need master to acquire and maintain
AFS tokens for it.  You will also need to create the ptclient
directory under your imap configdirectory, to hold the PTS cache (now
a full-fledged cyrusdb) and UNIX socket.  In <tt>cyrus.conf</tt>,
ptloader should be setup to listen on
<i>&lt;configdirectory&gt;</i>/ptclient/ptsock. See the
<tt>master/test/cmu-backend.conf</tt> example configuration file.</li>

<li>Also, <tt>ptloader</tt> has been given a generic interface. You
should now specify "<tt>--with-auth=pts</tt>" (instead of
"<tt>--with-auth=krb_pts</tt>") to <tt>configure</tt>.  There is also
a <tt>--with-pts=</tt> <tt>configure</tt> option that defaults to
<tt>afskrb</tt> (Kerberos Canonicalization, AFS PTS Groups).  There is
also an experimental ldap module.  Note also that if <tt>ptloader</tt>
fails the lookup, authorization (and therefore authentication) will
now fail, as canonicalization is done inside of ptloader.</li>

<li>The format of sieve referrals has changed to be more consistant
with the current managesieve draft, this may cause interoperability
problems when using managesieve clients and servers from different
cyrus versions.</li>

<li>Clients that use old-style ACL commands that include the
&quot;MAILBOX&quot; directive will no longer function.
We do not know of any clients that have this problem currently.</li>

<li>Any applications that link libcyrus.a now need to link libcyrus_min.a
as well.</li>


</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.1.13 or earlier</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are now more forgiving of MIME boundry headers generated by earlier
versions of eudora.  However, if you have messages already in the mailstore
that you want to fix you will need to reconstruct the affected mailboxes
to regenerate the cached bodystructure data to take this into account.
Nothing needs to be done for new messages to be treated in this way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.1.12 or earlier</h2>
<ul>
<li>timsieved was corrected to behave properly in the altnamespace configuration.
However, this means that it was previously looking for sieve scripts in
&quot;user.name&quot; format instead of the (correct) &quot;user^name&quot;
format.  A sample script to do this (which should be run in the top level of
the sieve directory) is in <tt>tools/convert-sieve.pl</tt>.  Note that this
is only needed if you are running with altnamespace turned on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.1.3 or earlier</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you use notifications (previously <tt>notify_zephyr</tt> or
<tt>notify_unix</tt>) this functionality has been seperated out to
<tt>notifyd</tt>.  See the <tt>notifyd</tt> manpage and example
entries in <tt>master/conf</tt>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.1.2 or earlier</h2>

<ul>
<li> Sieve has been updated to be compliant with RFC 3028 and
draft-martin-sieve-notify-01.  All <tt>notify</tt> actions and any
<tt>fileinto</tt> and/or <tt>redirect</tt> actions using stringlists
will have to be updated/changed. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.0.16 or earlier</h2>

<ul>
<li> You must install and configure Cyrus SASL version 2 to use Cyrus
IMAP 2.1 and later.  You can download SASL at <a
href="http://cyrusimap.web.cmu.edu/downloads.html#sasl">
http://cyrusimap.web.cmu.edu/downloads.html#sasl</a>.

<li> If you use <tt>timsieved</tt> to manage Sieve scripts, and have
enabled the alternate namespace and/or the Unix hierarchy separator,
run the script "<tt>tools/translatesieve</tt>".  This script will
translate the folder names in <tt>fileinto</tt> actions.

<li> Cyrus now uses the service name "sieve" instead of "imap" for the
SASL profile of <tt>timsieved</tt>. If you use <tt>timsieved</tt> to
manage Sieve scripts, be sure to update your password checking
mechanism appropriately,

<li> If you have enabled the improved directory hashing scheme, run
the script "<tt>tools/rehash full</tt>".  This script will rehash your
existing directories.

<li> The hashed deliver databases (used for duplicate delivery suppression
and Sieve) have been merged into a single <tt>deliver.db</tt> database.
You can safely remove the entire <tt>/var/imap/deliverdb</tt>
directory structure after shutting down the server.

<li>All of the Cyrus databases have been unified under a single BDB 
environment.  A new <tt>ctl_cyrusdb</tt> tool is now used for database 
recovery and checkpointing instead of <tt>ctl_mboxlist</tt> and 
<tt>ctl_deliver</tt>.  You should replace the appropriate <tt>START</tt> and 
<tt>EVENTS</tt> entries in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt> with those in the 
sample configurations in the <tt>master/conf</tt> directory.

<li> Cyrus now caches SSL/TLS sessions in an external database. If you
have support for SSL/TLS, and haven't disabled session caching (see
<tt>imapd.conf(5)</tt>), you should add a line like the following to
the <tt>EVENTS</tt> section of <tt>cyrus.conf</tt> to prune expired
sessions from the database:

<pre><kbd>   # this is only necessary if caching TLS sessions
   tlsprune      cmd="tls_prune" period=1440
</kbd></pre>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.0.6, 2.0.7, 2.0.8, or 2.0.9 or earlier</h2>

<ul>
<li> If you use <tt>timsieved</tt> to manage Sieve scripts, run the
script "<tt>tools/upgradesieve</tt>".  <tt>timsieved</tt> now uses
symlinks instead of hard links.
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from a previous 2.0 version to 2.0.6</h2>

<b>Warning:</b> You do not need to follow these instructions if you're
upgrading from version 1.6.

<ul>
<li>You can now pick whether to use Berkeley db to store seen state,
the subscription files, and the mailboxes file or a flat text file, at
compile time only.  (Look in <tt>imap/seen_db.c</tt> and
<tt>imap/mboxlist.h</tt>.)

<li>The format of the mailboxes file and seen state has changed.  It is
not possible to preserve seen state, but upgrade the mailboxes file as
follows:
<ol>
<li> Run <tt>ctl_mboxlist -d &gt; mboxlist.temp</tt> to dump existing
mailboxes.

<li> Remove old database files: <tt>rm mailboxes.db db/*
user/*/*.seen</tt>

<li>With the new version of ctl_mboxlist, run <tt>ctl_mboxlist -u &lt;
mboxlist.temp</tt>.
</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 1.6.22 or 1.6.24</h2>

<b>Warning:</b> Cyrus imapd 2.0 will automatically convert on-disk
file formats as the server is used.  <b>It is not possible to run 1.6
after 2.0 has been used on a mail spool without reconstructing every
mailbox.</b>

<ul>
<li>Create some extra directories and remove the duplicate delivery
database:
<pre>
<kbd>   mkdir /var/imap/db
   mkdir /var/imap/socket
   chown cyrus /var/imap/db /var/imap/socket
   rm -rf /var/imap/deliverdb
</kbd></pre>

<li>Convert mailboxes file to Berkeley DB:
<pre>
<kbd>   su cyrus
   cd /var/imap
   ctl_mboxlist -u &lt; mailboxes
   ctl_cyrusdb -c
</kbd></pre>

Please keep a backup of your mailboxes file.  You can dump an
old-style mailboxes file by using <tt>ctl_mboxlist -d</tt>.

<li>remove "<tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>" entries. The <tt>imap</tt> and
<tt>popd3d</tt> lines need to be removed from <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>
and inetd needs to be restarted.

<li>master process configuration: You'll need to configure the master
process Cyrus process and ensure that it starts on boot.  see <a
href="install-configure.html#master">this section</a> of the
configuration instructions.

<li>MTA configuration. You will have to reconfigure your MTA to speak
to lmtpd.  See <a href="install-configure.html#mta">this section</a> of
the configuration document.

<li>cyrus.seen conversion. The cyrus.seen file will be automatically
upgraded as users read mail.  After some time, you might want to
delete the cyrus.seen file in each mailbox; it is superceded by the
user/joe.seen file.

<li>cyrus.index conversion.  The cyrus.index file will be
automatically upgraded the first time each mailbox is SELECTed.

<li>Netnews conversion. The netnews programs are no longer built. If
you are using netnews, you will need to apply the diff in the
<tt>netnews/</tt> directory to INN or see if INN is now distributing
those changes.  You will also want to run <tt>remotepurge</tt> on a
regular basis to purge old netnews posts.

</ul>


<h2>Upgrading from 1.6.13</h2>
<ul>
<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.13 or earlier:
if you use Sieve, you should run the "<tt>tools/upgradesieve</tt>"
script, as the format of the "<tt>/usr/sieve</tt>" directory has
changed slightly.

<p>timsieved, included in this release, will handle maintenance of Sieve
scripts.

<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.10 or earlier:
if you export news via the IMAP server, you'll have to change your
"<tt>newsfeeds</tt>" file to contain
<pre>collectnews!:*:Tf,WR:collectnews</pre>  The format of the
input to collectnews has changed.

<p>Duplicate delivery suppression is now required for Sieve.

<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.1 or earlier
(including 1.5.x!): the quota and user directories are now hashed by
the first character of the username.  This is to reduce the number of
entries in any given directory. It doesn't do a great job (and in some
cases it will do a really poor job) but as a quick hack it shouldn't
make things worse.  Optionally, the data partitions can also be hashed
by enabling the "hashimapspool" option.

<p>You must hash your directories using the "<tt>dohash</tt>" script
in the tools subdirectory.  (If you want to hash your mail spool, be
sure to set "hashimapspool" before running "<tt>dohash</tt>".)  This
must be run as the Cyrus user. Be sure to stop mail service while
converting. Doing this in single user mode is probably the safest.

</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 1.5</h2>
<ul>
<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.5 or earlier:
libsasl is now required.  Configuring SASL to work may be a chore,
especially if you use shadow passwords.

<li> An ANSI C compiler is now required.  gcc should work fine and can
be acquired from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html</a>.

<li> Make sure to read the upgrading instructions under 1.6 above.

<li> Upgrading from 1.5.14 or earlier requires deleting the delivered
database.  Remove the file delivered.db in the configdirectory and make a
directory called "deliverdb" in the configdirectory.  This may cause some
duplicates to get through.

<li> Upgrading from 1.5.14 or earlier requires removing the PTS cache
database (if the AFS PTS group support is used, which is not the
default).  The PTS cache is in /var/ptclient/ptscache.db, and you
should remove it. This is because the format for the PTS cache for
IMSP has changed.  If you use AFS ACLs, IMSPd, and IMAPd on the same
machine, make sure you have version 1.5a5 of the IMSP server for this
version of the IMAP server.  (If you don't have IMSP, or AFS, don't
worry about it.)

</ul>
